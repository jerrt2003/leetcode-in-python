        Solution: Hashtable + sorted + tuple
        Time Complexity: O(NKlogK), where NN is the length of strs, and KK is the maximum length of a string in strs. The outer loop has complexity O(N)O(N) as we iterate through each string. Then, we sort each string in O(K \log K)O(KlogK) time.
        Space Complexity: O(NK)

        TP:
        - two words are anagram of each other only when their sorted string are the same
        - thus we can use sorted(str) as key to check if this key exist in the dict or not
            - if yes we append the string to the k/v
            - if ont we create a new k/v use new string
        - return dict.values()
        :type strs: List[str]
        :rtype: List[List[str]]
