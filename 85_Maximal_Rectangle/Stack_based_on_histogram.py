        Algorithm:
        - Every row in the matrix is viewed as the ground with some buildings on it
        - Create a list: height
        - Create a area = 0
        - Scan through every row, when element is 1, than add 1 to height[i] otherwise height[i] = 0 (reset)
        - Once complete update list: height then we can use histogram algorithm to find max rectangle areas
            - create a list: stack and push [-1] into it
            - go through the list: height, if height[i] <= height[stack[-1]], then
                - h: height[stack.pop()]
                - w: i - stack[-1] -1
                - area = max(area, h*w)
                - push i into stack
            - when reached the end of stack, start to pop the stack to calculate all possible max rectangle
                - h: height[stack.pop()]
                - w: len(row) - stack[-1] -1
                - area = max(area, h*w)
        - 一路升冪排序直到遇到第一個會造成降冪的Height!!!
