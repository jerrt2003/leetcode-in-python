        Inspired by: https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/discuss/69795/Java-solution-O(1)-space-and-O(n)-in-time
        TP:
        - we have only one missing number
        - We calculate what's the total sum should be (T_SUM)
        - then we find what's the current sum is (C_SUM)
        - missing number is: T_SUM - C_SUM
        Note:
        - 另外一種解法則是用hashset, 稍慢
