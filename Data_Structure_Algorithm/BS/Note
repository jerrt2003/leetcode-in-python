def BS(l, r):
    while l < r:
        m = (l+r-1)/2
        (optional) if f(m): return m <-- recommands: don't use, either way we'll find smallest number which satisfy g(m) (or f(m)
        if g(m):
            r = m
        else:
            l = m+1
    return l

** The key to the binary search is: Not to find the exact answer, but find the split point m such that for
all numbers n, n >= m, conditions g(m) will be satisfied, then m will naturally become answer for free

** the list for searching should be 單調遞增 (monotonic increasing)


Find minimal 'm' which satisfy g(m)
