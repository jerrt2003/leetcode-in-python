        Solution: Sliding Window
        Time Complexity: O(s+t)

        Inspired By: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/solution/
        TP:
        - using sliding window
            - use 2 pointer l, r to mark the start-end of the window
            - Once we found the window includes all the char(s) required, we'll do:
                - continue to contracting the window (l+=1) till the window is no longer include all required char(s)
            - then we move r by 1 (r+=1) and repeat above steps till we visit whole s
        - Key point:
            - Collection: Counter class
            - tuple to store answer
        :type s: str
        :type t: str
        :rtype: str
