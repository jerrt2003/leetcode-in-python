In the string ABCB, the second and forth letters are the same and the first and third letters are unique.
The same is true of the string XYZY.
Write a function that takes in two strings and returns whether they have their matching letters in the same locations
--e.g. the input (ABCBB, XQZQQ) would return True, and the input (ABCB, ABCA) would return False
(because the second and forth letters of ABCB match, but the first and forth letters of ABCA match).


Call a string “valid” if it introduces new letters in alphabetical order: the first letter is an A,
the first letter that isn’t an A is a B, the first letter that isn’t an A or a B is a C, and so on.
So AAAABAC is valid, but BCD is not and ABD is not. Write a function to determine if a string is valid.
