        TP:
        - a/b = 2.0, b/c = 3.0
          We can build a directed graph:
          a -- 2.0 --> b -- 3.0 --> c
          If we were asked to find a/c, we have:
          a/c = a/b * b/c = 2.0 * 3.0
          In the graph, it is the product of costs of edges.
          Do notice that, 2 edges need to added into the graph with one given equation,
          because with a/b we also get result of b/a, which is the reciprocal of a/b.
          so the previous example also gives edges:
          c -- 0.333 --> b -- 0.5 --> a
